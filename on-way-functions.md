Hash functions not being reverible to polynomial time in the worst-case is P != NP and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_time_hypothesis
Hash functions not being reverible to polynomial time in the average-case is the basis of a lot of cryptography.

When you try to link this irreversibility to [entanglement](./link-with-entanglement.md), it's hard to find work online about that because you get a lot of links about quantum computing that isn't necessarily related to the arrow of time.
