## List of existing time theories

### Philosophical time theories

It seems the angle that assumes that time comes from syntropy is not in the list, except for [Causal Set Theory](./causal-set-theory.md).

### Link with entanglement

I understand that in the 80s somebody already said that causality comes from entanglement, and that in 2014 somebody else proved some theoretical result about it, but I don't yet understand what it was that was proved in 2014.
