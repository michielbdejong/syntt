# Syntropic Time Theory

In this repository I'm exploring the relationship between syntropy, causality, and the arrow of time.

List of philosophical time theories: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time/

It seems the angle that assumes that time comes from syntropy is not in the list, except for [Causal Set Theory](https://philarchive.org/archive/WTHOON) which are mentioned towards the end ([their reference costs 25 USD to download](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1093/bjps/axv040?journalCode=bjps).
