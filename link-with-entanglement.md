Time's arrow traced to quantum source:

I understand that in the 80s [Seth LLoyd](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Lloyd) [already said](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.0378.pdf) that causality comes from entanglement, and that in 2014 Tony Short et al. proved some theoretical result about it, but I don't yet understand what it was that was proved in 2014. Maybe it's "reaching equilibrium is a universal property of quantum systems" -> https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.79.061103 (35USD)

“The present can be defined by the process of becoming correlated with our surroundings.”
